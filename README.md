# Kaggle House Price Competition

This repo is to share some models and techniques I use in the competition such as LGBM regressor and XGB regressor. I start with a simple model and improve it with feature engineering and parameters optimization.

## File Organization

In the project/workspace folder we should have: the models notebooks/python_files (like lgbm1.ipynb) and the 'input' folder (where the dataset should be - just unzip the files there).
